I actually worked on the project yesterday but couldn't update the repo cause of network issues(no data).Still working on the project,hope to be done soon.

I'm also watching bio-informatics videos on the side since I'm greatly interested in that

# Day 10

*date-*

Announcing Hiatus !!!

*am i even allowed to do this ?*
Anywayyy, I've been having tests and my exams are dangerously close...and I have a heck load of other 'excuses' to give but the point here is that I've chosen to take a tech break and focus on school till I'm done with exams and my academic life is no longer in danger.

I'm actually still working on the project but i'll carve out a few days where i'll only work on the project and be done with so I can focus solely on exams. 

After my exams I will continue thiss -whatever this is- and write a summary of the project and stuff I learnt in the process.

But for now... I bid you farewell github :v:
