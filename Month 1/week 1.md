## Day 01

*date - wednesday-26th-july*

I have a few weeks to exam so haven't really been doing much.

I am currently working on a chatbot like integration stuff to enable students gain insights from their pdfs with AI. I've previously made something like this 'PIZE' that accepts documents and sets questions from the documents, but  i'm hoping this is better.

Started watching this video on creating a pdf chat-app with langchain, not the exact thing I want to do but it's a good place to start.
