## Day 01

*date - wednesday-26th-july*

I have a few weeks to exam so haven't really been doing much.

I am currently working on a chatbot like integration stuff to enable students gain insights from their pdfs with AI. I've previously made something like this 'PIZE' that accepts documents and sets questions from the documents, but  i'm hoping this is better.

Started watching this video on creating a pdf chat-app with langchain, not the exact thing I want to do but it's a good place to start.

> the next one month is just going to be about me working on this project so feel free to skip to the next part if you want to

## Day 02

*date - Thursday-27th-July*

Still watch the video and trying to understand what's going on before I start working on it. I'm wondering if I can use an opensource model like BERT(at least I think it's opensource) instead of using the openAI api since it's not free.


## Day 03

*date - Friday-28th-July*

Exam is closer than ever. Really wasn't going to do anything but I decided that it was fine as long as I watched just a few minutes of the video above and that's exactly what I did, a little is better than nothing at all I suppose. Really should've been done with the video by now since it isn't even that long...but whatever.

Weekends are for writing articles according to my calendar, hope I'm able to write one this weekend. If not I should at least complete the video and start something.

Fighting!!
